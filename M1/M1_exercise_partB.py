1.19 Exercise: Python Part B
Once you have reviewed all of the scripts for module 1, complete Module 01 Exercise: Python Part B.

This activity can be found at the end of pyScript13.py.
 

    Create a long sentence of words [assume NO punctuation].
    Put the words into a list. (Hint: How are the words separated?) (Separating the words can be done 
                                                                     before the list comprehension.)
    Use a list comprehension to return the word along with the length of it. Use this →  (word, len(word)).
    Finally, print out all the words (along with the word length).

If you’ve finished . . .
 

    Print out the word-size tuples in sorted order by length (smallest to largest)
    Done that, too?   Print out only unique words (i.e., no repetitions).
